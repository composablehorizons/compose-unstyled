**Minimum reproducible code**

A minimum reproducible example is **required** and issues without this will be closed.

What we need is the minimal required code in order to reproduce the issue you are facing.

Because of this, only Compose Unstyled and Compose Foundation dependencies are allowed. Do not include other dependencies such as Material Compose. Include any imports if possible, but not required.

Links to reproducible projects are also allowed. Note that the projects themselves must be created for the sole purpose of reproducing the issue. This **must not** be your real project.
